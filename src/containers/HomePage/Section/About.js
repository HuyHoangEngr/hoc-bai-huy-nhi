                            Upgrading acknowledge is very important with me in
                            order to support for you to get the better products
                            what customers want. I've been appreciated by my
                            friends that has good team work and independence
                            work. I want to work at a company that has the
                            systematic and realistic working method. I want to
                            work with you for a long time. I think I will have a
                            rank of salary that fits with my capacity.
